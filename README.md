## Bojana Golubovic Makeup
This is a Next.js application designed for the needs of makeup artists and users who aim to easily book makeup appointments, purchase makeup gift vouchers, read useful makeup tips, or leave comments on the work of the makeup artist. For some of the mentioned features, users need to be logged in via their Google account, while purchasing gift vouchers also requires an additional PayPal account. Purchased gift vouchers and appointment reservation details are sent to the user's email address. The content, including used gift vouchers, galleries, and the appointment cancellation process, can only be managed by the makeup artist. In terms of styling the application, the Tailwind CSS framework is used, and the data is stored in a MongoDB database.
